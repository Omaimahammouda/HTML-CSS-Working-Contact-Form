# HTML-CSS-Working-Contact-Form

This repository contains a functional HTML/CSS contact form created using Web3Forms.

### About

I created this contact form to be useful for collecting user inquiries and messages easily on my website.

### Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the contact form.
3. Fill out the form with your contact details and message.
4. Click the "Submit" button to send the form.
5. Check your email inbox for the received message with the form details.

**Note:** Don't forget to replace the `access_key` in the HTML form with your own access key from Web3Forms. This ensures that the submitted forms are sent to your email inbox.
